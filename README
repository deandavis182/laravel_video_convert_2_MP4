This is a minimal video converter app built in Laravel.

In this app, PHP uses ffmpeg to convert videos. So you will need to have ffmpeg installed on machine.


The app will :
    
    Give a form to upload video file.
    
    Take the POST file

    Convert uploaded file to: TIMESTAMP + output.mp4 via ffmpeg

    Redirect user to page displaying the converted video + download link

    


This app is bare-bones, and has a ton of things to be added in the future :)
